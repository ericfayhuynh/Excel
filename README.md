# Excel Challenge

### Background
The challenge focuses on analyzing crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo. I'm tasked with exploring a dataset of 1,000 sample projects to identify key trends for crowdfunding success or failure.

### Objective
I'm using Excel to perform a variety of operations on this dataset. My tasks include applying conditional formatting, creating new columns for additional metrics, and using pivot tables for data analysis. The ultimate goal is to identify factors that contribute to the success of crowdfunding campaigns.

### Summary
In the project, I applied conditional formatting to highlight the outcomes and funding percentages of each campaign. I added new columns to calculate metrics such as 'Percent Funded' and 'Average Donation.' To dive deeper into the data, I utilized pivot tables and charts, focusing on different criteria like the category of the campaign and its launch date. Finally, I performed a statistical analysis of the dataset to understand the distribution of the number of backers for both successful and unsuccessful campaigns. These steps allowed me to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the dataset and gain valuable insights into the factors affecting crowdfunding success.

### Tools and Technologies
Microsoft Excel

### Data Source
